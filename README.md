Playground testing out methods to upgrade html table/row/cell structures to modern container structures for responsive layouts.

Demo: https://herrbasan.github.io/ResponsiveTables/

Note: Complete rework, much much simpler and yet more accessible, as the standard behaviour of tables is actually good in terms of accessibility.
Removed the old approach into the archive_unused folder.
